# SchoolWork
This is where i'll be saving code for schoolwork

I write C code for classes on my linux laptop, but i want my code to be crossplatform complatible(as much as i can). 

The Microcontroller i use at school is an "ST Nucleo 303RE" so programs are written for that and copied to mbed.org's IDE and compiler.
